## Summary of business problem and project objective
Home Credit is facing a significant challenge in accurately assessing the repayment capabilities of prospective borrowers with limited or no credit history. This leads to the risks of approving loans for individuals likely to default and rejecting applicants who can actually repay. To address this issue, Home Credit is seeking an advanced analytics solution that utilizes their data to improve the prediction of clients' repayment abilities. By implementing this solution, Home Credit aims to reduce financial losses, make informed loan approval decisions, and promote financial inclusion for the unbanked population. The project will focus on building a predictive model using alternative data and supervised learning techniques to achieve its objectives. The success of the project will be measured based on the accuracy of repayment predictions, reduction in loan defaults, increased loan approvals, and overall improvement in Home Credit's financial performance.
The goal of the "Home Credit Default Risk" project is to develop predictive models that can accurately assess the likelihood of clients defaulting on their loan payments. By leveraging various data points and features, the project aims to provide insights to the lending institution for better credit risk assessment and decision-making.
